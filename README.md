# PWD - Personal Web Desktop

As made for an assignment at Linneaus University, autumn 2016. The Personal Web Desktop application includes a memory 
application, a chat application an application of your own choice (in this case a notepad application) and an informational window. 

The chat application was initially run on Linneaus University's own servers, although that server considers the operation to
 be insecure when running it on github. Therefore, the chat application is for the time being not working properly. You may still type in messages,
 but there is no way to send or receive them. This will however be fixed in the near future.
